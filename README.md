- ðŸ‘‹  Hi, Iâ€™m Daniel Hinds
  
Iâ€™m analytically minded with a strong foundation in Computer Science and Mathematics. My academic background has honed my problem-solving abilities, logical thinking and attention to detail. 

I have worked on several personal projects, developing software, debugging issues, and interacting with customers on a small scale. While these projects didn't achieve large-scale success, they provided valuable insights into software development and the challenges of selling software. The most notable projects are now available as open-source on my GitHub. 

As I progress in my studies and seek opportunities in software engineering, I am eager to apply my programming and AWS knowledge to build scalable and efficient solutions to solve real-world challenges.
